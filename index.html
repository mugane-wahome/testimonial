     <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

 <p id="patoparagraph">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and

   <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
                        program
                        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a
                        capable
                        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need
                        from
                        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

 <p class="kiraparagraph"><strong>a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</strong> </p>

  <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                        former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                        staff
                        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                        offers.
                        100% recommend! ”
